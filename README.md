Hearthstone Clone

Created by Kaiwen Liu. This is my first game coding by C++ in life. Approximation 40 hours coding spent on this game.

This is game for two people to play and the goal is to destory your enemy. Each player has opportunity to draw cards and play minions or magic cards.
You control minions to attack enemy's minion or itself in order to reduce his health. Those skills, magic or enchatment are helpful to win this game.

Hopefully you will enjoy the game!
